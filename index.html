    Problem No:-1
    Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers 
    such that they add up to target.

    You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the 
    same element twice.

    Sample input/output:
    Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
    Output: [0,1]
    Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].

    Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
    Output: [1,2]

    Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
    Output: [0,1]

    Problem No:-2
    Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.

    Example 1:

    Input: x = 121
    Output: true
    Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.
    Example 2:

    Input: x = -121
    Output: false
    Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-.    
    Therefore it is not a palindrome.
    Example 3:

    Input: x = 10
    Output: false
    Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

    Problem No:-3
    Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.

    Symbol       Value
    I             1
    V             5
    X             10
    L             50
    C             100
    D             500
    M             1000
    For example, 2 is written as II in Roman numeral, just two ones added together. 12 is     
    written as XII, which is simply X + II. The number 27 is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.

    Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the     
    numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. Because the one is     
    before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, 
    which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

    I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9. 
    X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90. 
    C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.
    Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.
    Example 1:

    Input: s = "III"
    Output: 3
    Explanation: III = 3.
    Example 2:

    Input: s = "LVIII"
    Output: 58
    Explanation: L = 50, V= 5, III = 3.
    Example 3:

    Input: s = "MCMXCIV"
    Output: 1994
    Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.

    Problem No:-4 
    Create a Java Program that takes two numbers (num, length) and returns an array of 
    multiples of num until the array length reaches length.

Examples
intput= 7  5
output=[7, 14, 21, 28, 35]

input=12 10
output [12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96, 108, 120]

input=17 6
output= [17, 34, 51, 68, 85, 102]
Notes
Notice that num is also included in the returned array.

    Problem No:-5 
    There's a great war between the even and odd numbers. Many numbers already 
    lost their lives in this war and it's your task to end this. You have to 
    determine which group sums larger: the evens, or the odds. The larger group wins.

Write a Java program that takes an array of integers, sums the even and odd 
numbers separately, then returns the difference between the 
sum of the even and odd numbers.

Examples
input=[2, 8, 7, 5]  output= 2
// 2 + 8 = 10
// 7 + 5 = 12
// 12 is larger than 10
// So we return 12 - 10 = 2

[12, 90, 75] => 27

[5, 9, 45, 6, 2, 7, 34, 8, 6, 90, 5, 243] => 168

    Problem No:-6 
    Write a Java program which simulates the game "rock, paper, scissors". it must takes 
    the input of both players (rock, paper or scissors), first parameter from first player, 
    second from second player. The function returns the result as such:

"Player 1 wins"
"Player 2 wins"
"TIE" (if both inputs are the same)
The rules of rock, paper, scissors, if not known:

Both players have to say either "rock", "paper" or "scissors" at the same time.
Rock beats scissors, paper beats rock, scissors beat paper.
Examples
input = "rock", "paper"    output =  "Player 2 wins"

input = "paper", "rock"     output =  "Player 1 wins"

input = "paper", "scissors"     output =  "Player 2 wins"

input = "scissors", "scissors"    output =  "TIE"

input = "scissors", "paper"          output =  "Player 1 wins"

    Problem No:-7 
    One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest 
    and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales 
    showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however 
    they faced a hard problem.

Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon 
in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is 
not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their 
meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide 
the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.

Input
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1≤w≤100) — the weight of 
the watermelon bought by the boys.

Output
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing 
even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.

Examples
input=
8
output=
YES
Note
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively 
(another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos)

    Problem No:-8
Sometimes some words like "localization" or "internationalization" are so long that writing them 
many times in one text is quite tiresome.

Let's consider a word too long, if its length is strictly more than 10 characters. All too long 
words should be replaced with a special abbreviation.

This abbreviation is made like this: we write down the first and the last letter of a word and 
between them we write the number of letters between the first and the last letters. That number 
is in decimal system and doesn't contain any leading zeroes.

Thus, "localization" will be spelt as "l10n", and "internationalization» will be spelt as "i18n".

You are suggested to automatize the process of changing the words with abbreviations. At that 
all too long words should be replaced by the abbreviation and the words that are not too long 
should not undergo any changes.

Input
The first line contains an integer n (1≤n≤100). Each of the following n lines contains 
one word. All the words consist of lowercase Latin letters and possess the lengths of 
from 1 to 100 characters.

Output
Print n lines. The i-th line should contain the result of replacing of the i-th word 
from the input data.

Examples

    Problem No:-9 
One day three best friends Petya, Vasya and Tonya decided to form a team and take part 
in programming contests. Participants are usually offered several problems during 
programming contests. Long before the start the friends decided that they will implement
a problem if at least two of them are sure about the solution. Otherwise, the friends
won't write the problem's solution.

This contest offers n problems to the participants. For each problem we know, which 
friend is sure about the solution. Help the friends find the number of problems 
for which they will write a solution.

Input
The first input line contains a single integer n (1≤n≤1000) — the number of problems 
in the contest. Then n lines contain three integers each, each integer is either 0 or 1. 
If the first number in the line equals 1, then Petya is sure about the problem's solution, 
otherwise he isn't sure. The second number shows Vasya's view on the solution, 
the third number shows Tonya's view. The numbers on the lines are separated by spaces.

Output
Print a single integer — the number of problems the friends will implement on the contest.

Examples
input=
3
1 1 0
1 1 1
1 0 0
output=
2

input=
2
1 0 0
0 1 1
output=

Note
In the first sample Petya and Vasya are sure that they know how to solve the first 
problem and all three of them know how to solve the second problem. That means that 
they will write solutions for these problems. Only Petya is sure about the solution 
for the third problem, but that isn't enough, so the friends won't take it.

In the second sample the friends will only implement the second problem, as Vasya 
and Tonya are sure about the solution.

"Contestant who earns a score equal to or greater than the k-th place finisher's score 
will advance to the next round, as long as the contestant earns a positive score..." 
— an excerpt from contest rules.

A total of n participants took part in the contest (n≥k), and you already know their 
scores. Calculate how many participants will advance to the next round.

Input
The first line of the input contains two integers n and k (1≤k≤n≤50) 
separated by a single space.

The second line contains n space-separated integers a1,a2,...,an (0≤ai≤100), 
where ai is the score earned by the participant who got the i-th place. The given 
sequence is non-increasing (that is, for all i from 1 to n-1 the following 
condition is fulfilled: ai≥ai+1).

Output
Output the number of participants who advance to the next round.
